# `dist/index.js` is a special file in a custom action.
#
# When you reference an action with `uses` in a workflow, `index.js` is the
# code that will run.
#
# For this project, `index.js` is generated through a build process which
# compiles the TypeScript to JavaScript, then compiles the result into a single
# file with all its dependencies using ncc (https://github.com/vercel/ncc).
#
# This workflow checks that the commited `index.js` matches the `index.js`
# generated from the source files.
